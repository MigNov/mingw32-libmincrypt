 libminCrypt application README
 ===============================

This library is the implementation of minCrypt algorithm as based
on the minCrypt design document written to provide simple algorithm
implementation on the minimum number of source files.

Current version of the library is 0.0.4 which implements both symmetric
and asymmetric encryption methods. The original version was designed to
be embedded directly into the application however as the system got
more complex I've decided to split the project into binary and library
forms.

If you want to create the RPM packages for application the ./autobuild.sh
script will create it for you.

The algorithm has been implemented in C language with requirements
for math library (libm) and it's distributed under the LGPLv2+ licence.

Terminology
-----------

This library should be referred to as libminCrypt.
